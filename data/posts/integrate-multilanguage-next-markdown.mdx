Next English I recently started my final project of my electronic engineering degree, in this case I needed to control
the pulse of a sine wave (AC) in order to control a high power light bulb.

Searching the internet I found many ways to do it, however, most of them were already prefabricated in a
card, or with components that are not commercialized in my country, so I thought, **why not do it from scratch?**

Here I give you the circuit and an example code.

## Zero cross detection

The zero crossing detector indicates when the sine wave crosses ground (GND).

We use zero-crossing detection to establish at what frequency the wave passes through our microcontroller
(usually 50Hz or 60Hz), and also emit a pulse when a voltage signal passes through 0V.

## Digital dimmer

So, every time the zero crossing pulse passes through 0V, it emits a signal that calls an interrupt in the microcontroller,
This interruption activates and deactivates for a short time the LED inside the MOC 3020 generating pulses and activating the gate of the Triac BTA 16.

We have to take into account that the zero crossing occurs in the middle of the signal, so, when applying the period formula we have to divide it by 2.

By example: T = 1/60 = 16.66 ms --> T/2 = 8.33 ms.

## Connection to Arduino

Here are all the necessary connections to make a digital dimmer.

## Code

```c++
int Zero_Cross_Pin = 2;
int Firing_Pin = 3;

String Input_String = "";
bool String_Completedd = false;
int Max_Firing_Delay = 7400;
int Min_Firing_Delay = 1350;
int Interval_Delay = 833;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(Firing_Pin, OUTPUT);
  attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(Zero_Cross_Pin), ZERO_CROSS_ISR, RISING);
}

void loop() {
   if (String_Completed) {
    int brightness = constrain(Input_String.toInt(), 0 , 100);
    Firing_Delay = map(brillo, 0, 100, Max_Firing_Delay, Min_Firing_Delay);
    Serial.println("Bulb brightness intensity: " + (String)brightness + "%");
    Input_String = "";
    String_Completed = false;
  }
}

void serialEvent() {
  while (Serial.available() > 0) {
    char inChar = (char)Serial.read();
    if (inChar == '\n')
      String_Completed = true;
    else
      Input_String += inChar;
  }
}

void ZERO_CROSS_ISR() {
  delayMicroseconds(Firing_Delay);
  digitalWrite(Firing_Pin, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(Interval_Delay);
  digitalWrite(Firing_Pin, LOW);
}
```
