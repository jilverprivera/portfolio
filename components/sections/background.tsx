            As a software developer, I always like to try to link engineering,
            design and long-term scalability. My goal is to always create
            applications that are efficient and at the same time deliver
            engaging and seamless user experiences.

            When I&apos;m not in front of a screen, I&apos;m probably
            exercising, reading a book, watching a series, walking my dogs or
            crossing another item off my bucket list.
